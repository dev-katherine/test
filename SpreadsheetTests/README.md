# Comments to :

These tests were written to verify the correctness and full coverage of the Spreadsheet implementation for CS 3500 Assignment 4 - Onward to a Spreadsheet.
All tests are original and created by the student to achieve complete branch and exception coverage across all public and protected behaviors defined in AbstractSpreadsheet.cs.
Each test targets a specific behavior, including input validation, circular dependency detection, dependency graph updates, and recalculation order correctness.


# Assignment Specific Topics:

- Validation & exception handling (InvalidNameException, ArgumentNullException, CircularException)
- Core spreadsheet content management (strings, doubles, formulas)
- Dependency graph updates and recalculation order correctness
- Cycle detection and rollback
- Complete branch and path coverage across all public Spreadsheet methods


# Consulted Peers:

I didn't discussed with anyone since writing a test cases always the same process with previous assignments. 
# References:

I didn't reference to other cites since this test cases have the same format with previous assignments.
