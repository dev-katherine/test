File Description:  

This file contains the FormulaTests class, which provides unit tests to validate  
the correctness and robustness of the <c>Formula</c> class implementation.  

Comments to FormulaTests:  

- Covers all edge cases and corner cases of the Formula class.  
- Validates formula parsing, evaluation, and comparison under different parameters.  
- Tests evaluation with double precision and supports scientific notation.  
- Ensures proper error handling for scenarios like division by zero and invalid input.  


Assignment Specific Topics:

The FormulaTests class thoroughly verifies the functionality of the Formula class.  
It tests arithmetic operations, operator precedence, variable handling, and equality checks,  
including cases involving null states. The suite also ensures exceptions are raised correctly  
for invalid operations. Additionally, it confirms support for scientific notation, enabling  
precise evaluation of both large and small numeric values.  
This comprehensive testing framework strengthens the reliability and maintainability of the  
Formula class for future extensions.
