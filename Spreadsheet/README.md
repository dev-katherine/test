# Comments to Evaluators:
    Spreadsheet Class which is a subclass of Abstractspreadsheet class
    The Spreadsheet class manages cells, their contents and manage dependcies between cells by using a dependency graph.  It makes to support recalculation of the cell
    This project has Formula project, and DependencyGraph project as reference.

# Assignment Specific Topics
    1. Implements spreadsheet with dependency tracking by using DependencyGraph project
    2. Check validation of ell names and prevent circular dependencies
    3. Able to set cell contents with text, double, and formula
    4. recalculates dependent cells
    +
    5. Normalization for Cell contents has been added
    6. Formuala calculation is now available
    7. save cells to file is now available


# My Software Project
    1. create a function for consistantly repeated logic
    2. contains the purpose of the function  when naming the helper function
    3. test the codes simultaneously with function implementation to ensure that the function works properly

# Consulted Peers:
